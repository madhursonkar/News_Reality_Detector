### Fake News Detector

The Fake News Detector is a simple application that uses a machine learning model to classify news articles as either fake or real. The application uses a pre-trained model and a dataset of labeled news articles to make
predictions.
We can extend this to training our own model that will be able to classify news articles based on the content of the article with even more accuracy.
It is a self project that I did to learn more about machine learning and how to apply it to real world problems.
